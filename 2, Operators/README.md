<h4>Objective</h4>
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

<h4>Task</h4>
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

<h4>Example</h4>
mealcost=100
tippercent=15
taxpercent=8

A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.

<h4>Function Description</h4>
Complete the solve function in the editor below.

solve has the following parameters:

int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tip_percent: the tip percentage
int tax_percent: the tax percentage
Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.
