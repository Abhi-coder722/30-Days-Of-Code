<h4>Objective</h4>
Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

<h4>Task</h4>
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: () is considered to be an even index.

<h4>Example</h4>

s=adbecf<br>
Print abc def

<h4>Input Format</h4>

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).<br>
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S.

<h4>Output Format</h4>

For each String S , print S's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by S's odd-indexed characters.
