<h4>Objective</h4>
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

<h4>Task</h4>
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

<h4>Example</h4>
n=125
The binary representation of (125)10 is 11111101. In base 2, there are 1 and n consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

<h4>Input Format</h4>

A single integer, n.


<h4>Output Format/<h4>
