<h4>Objective</h4>
Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

<h4>Task</h4>
Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

<h4>Example</h4>
A=[1,2,3,4]<br>

Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.

<h4>Input Format</h4>

The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe array A's elements.
<h4>Output Format</h4>

Print the elements of array  in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

4<br>
1 4 3 2<br>
